# CWP Basic Recipe metapackage

The purpose of this module is to provide an easy way to obtain just the right mix of modules for a given CWP recipe
release. Including a stable, latest release of this module in your project implies you are running a compliant
supported baseline.

Note: the stability of the site could still be affected by modules you add on top of this foundational mix.
